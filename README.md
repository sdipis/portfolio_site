# new-portfolio

Using VUE JS for a front end, and PHP to power the CMS in the backend, this website packs more than it lets on.

Use the grid portfolio found on the homepage to create some unique layouts of the works you want to present. Using the CMS, you can change the size of the tile displayed for each project from:
-small (span 1)
-mid (span 2)
-wide (span 3)
-large (span 4)

Add projects at ../admin/project_list.php

Make sure to upload your desired image before adding the project. It will auto fill the path of the latest img upload on the project add form.
